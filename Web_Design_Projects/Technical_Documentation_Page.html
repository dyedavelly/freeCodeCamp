                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
                    It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment 
                    (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the 
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, 
                    and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control 
                    structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of 
                    purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to 
                        control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, 
                        client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form 
                        and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant 
                        to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an 
                        application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from 
                        one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names 
                    of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign 
                    ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, 
                    letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" 
                    (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also
                     use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal
                      names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

            <header>Data Types</header>
            <article>
               <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>
                       <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                       <ul>
                           <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                           <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                                is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other
                                variant.</li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and 
                                immutable.</li>
                       </ul>
                    </li>
                   <li>and Object</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to 
                   perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the 
                   other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named 
                   containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can 
                   perform.</p>
            </article>

            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. 
                    The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable 
                    identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and 
                    can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script 
                    is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
                <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. 
                    If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
                <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. 
                    For example:</p>
                <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL 
                    CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                    }</code>
                <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is 
                    executed without problems.</p>
                <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>

            <header>Global Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages 
                    the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables 
                    using the window.variable syntax.
                </p>
                <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or 
                    frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. 
                    For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, 
                    you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>

            <header>Function Declarations</header>
            <article>
                <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function 
                    statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function.</li>
                    <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
                    <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
                <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists 
                    of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, 
                    number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned 
                    by the function.</p>
                <code>return number * number;</code>
                <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; 
                    the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, 
                    this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>

            <article>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global 
                    variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. 
                    When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, 
                    because it is available only within that function.</p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>

            <article>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <code>var x = 42.</code>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
                <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                <code>x = 42.</code>
                <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. 
                    You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
                <code>let y = 13.</code>

                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
